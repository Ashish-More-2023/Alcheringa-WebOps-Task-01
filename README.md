Hello
i have used jquery for better readability and less code work
the website is responsive and all dropdowns are functional . if you click anywhere else all drop downs will be closed.
if the screen is shrunk side panel will disappear and a menu button will appear which triggers menu .
edit and delete buttons are functional 
table may take few seconds to load.
